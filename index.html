        <p>A small collection of GPGPU computing samples, free of complicated utility library clutter.</p>

<p>I started writing these samples because I was tired of having to wade through oceans of utility code (I'm looking at you, DXUT) to figure out the samples that ship with most SDKs that one needs for GPU computing.  Since I like having minimalist samples around to use as a starting point for new projects, I thought I'd put them somewhere I wouldn't lose them.</p>

<p>These samples are all standalone, so that you don't have to go on a wild goose chase to figure out what's being done.  As much as possible, everything is done in a straightforward sequence of steps, all in the main() function.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, can think of a way to make one of the samples clearer or less cluttered, or if you can think of some other samples that would be useful, please let me know.</p>
