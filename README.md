No-nonsense-GPU-samples
=======================

A small collection of GPU computing samples, free of complicated
utility library clutter.

I started writing these samples because I was tired of having to wade
through oceans of DXUT and GLUT calls to figure out the samples that
ship with most SDKs that one needs for GPU computing.  I figured other
people might like to see them.

These samples are all standalone, so that you don't have to go on a
wild goose chase to figure out what's being done.  As much as
possible, everything is done in a straightforward sequence of steps,
all in the main() function.

If you find a bug, can think of a way to make one of the samples
clearer or less cluttered, or if you can think of some other samples
that would be useful, please let me know.
