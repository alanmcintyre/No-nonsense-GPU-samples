No-nonsense-GPU-samples
=======================

A small collection of GPU computing samples, free of complicated utility library clutter.

I started writing these samples because I was tired of having to wade through oceans of DXUT and GLUT calls to figure out the samples that ship with most SDKs that one needs for GPU computing.  I figured other people might like to see them.
